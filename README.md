## background

Having been a student of mnemonics since the 80's, things like remembering dumb but impressive stuff like a shuffled deck of cards or pi to XX numbers has always been fun.

Without these memory tricks I can't remember beyond about ten numbers, off top of my head... 3.141592653 - yep, first nine decimals I can do by rote, but need to use training to access the rest.

Point being, I've researched innumerable methods, and the main problem is every single one of them are super personal.

Using a highly personalised system for memorizing is great for custom scenarios, however pi is a constant, and there's no reason there can't be a standardised method for memorising it.

Thinking stuff like the ABC song, you don't need to have your own personal version to remember the alphabet. This should be applicable to at least the first 100 digits of pi.

So in here I'll slowly build up ways to use mnemonic devices and nursery rhymes and such, some of which will be customisable, until we come to a consensus on what is applicable universally.
